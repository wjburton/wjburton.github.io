Recent analytics graduate student the Institute of Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University. I moved to San Jose, CA in May, 2017 to work as a Data and Analytics Consultant at KPMG. 
I love spending time researching new data science/engineering topics and diving deep until I can see the whole picture. This site will serve as a platform to document some of my work, as well as be a reference to data science and other miscellaneous topics.
